      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>For some developers, the best way to learn how to use a gem is to see
      how other projects use it in the real world. But what if you can't easily
      find a project that uses the gem you're trying to learn about?  Gemphile
      was created to index the Gemfiles and gemspecs of Ruby projects on GitHub
      and then to provide a simple search interface to find those projects.</p>

      <h2>Why don't I see my project?</h2>
      <p>Except for a few projects added as seed data, Gemphile is entirely
      opt-in.  If you'd like to contribute to the site and have us index your
      project, just add a GitHub <a href="http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/">post-receive</a>
      hook for your projects pointing to <a href="http://gemphile.org/push">http://gemphile.org/push</a>
      then test it and the site will pull in your dependencies, as well as
      update them when you change your Gemfile or gemspec.</p>
